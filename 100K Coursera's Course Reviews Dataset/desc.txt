Context
This dataset was used for my undergraduate research. The main problem in this dataset is its imbalanced nature.

Content
I scraped the website of Coursera and pre-labelled the dataset depending on their rating. For a 5-star rating, the review was labelled as Very Positive, Positive for 4-star, Neutral for 3-star, Negative for 2-star, and Very Negative for 1-star. There are 2 files, reviews.tsv and reviewsbycourse.tsv. The reviews.tsv file has no grouping, just the course reviews and their corresponding label. For the reviewsbycourse.tsv, they are grouped by the CourseId column.

reviews.tsv
Id - The unique identifier for a review.

Review - The actual course review.

Label - The rating of the course review.

reviewsbycourse.tsv
CourseId - The course tag. This is in the URL of the course in the Coursera website. For example, in this URL, machine-learning would be the course tag.

Review - A review in a specific course.

Label - The rating of the course review.
